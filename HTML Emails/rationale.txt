Since Merriweather is not a web-safe font, we need to ensure that if the font fails to load, the email will still look good.
Therefore, adding fallback fonts is necessary. The following fonts are commonly used as fallbacks for Merriweather:
- Georgia
- Times New Roman
- serif
So the font-family should be updated to:
font-family: 'Merriweather', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
